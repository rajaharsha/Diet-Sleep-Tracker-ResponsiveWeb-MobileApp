Two modes for the app: 14 day intervention- Coach Z’s bootcamp (organized logic) and refresher mode (random tips).

For Coach Z’s boot camp, users fill out their sleep diary (the same questions every day) twice a day- in the morning and evening.  Users are also provided two tips every day (one after their morning entry, and one after their evening entry).   The logic identifying the diary question that dictates the tip for the day and what tip(s) should be pulled based on the user’s answer for that diary question is written out below.  If the tip is not being pulled from a specific diary question then a reference to a standard tip is noted (“S_”).
